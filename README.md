`{goldilocks}` implements the theoretical permutation approach developed in this [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245186542100048X) in an interactive [Shiny](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) application. It allows researchers to randomize cluster randomized trials with confidence by visualizing the distribution of average differences in the treatment and control arms in practice randomizations. The application also allows researchers to randomize a trial and download the resultant randomizations. The [Goldilocks application](bit.ly/GoldilocksApp) is deployed on the web but some researchers may prefer an R package.
