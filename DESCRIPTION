Description: The Goldilocks package implements the theoretical permentation
    approach developed in this article is an interactive Shiny application. 
    This package allows researchers to randomize cluster randomized trials with 
    confidence by visualizing the distribution of average differences in the 
    treatment and control arms in practice randomizations. The application also 
    allows researchers to randomize a trial and download the resultant 
    randomizations. The Goldilocks application is deployed on the web put some 
    researchers may prefer an R package.
